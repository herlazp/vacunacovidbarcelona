# vacunacovidbarcelona
Daily COVID-19 vaccination data in Barcelona
----------
This project explores the complete data cycle, starting with the extraction, transformation and load of daily official vaccination data (dadescovid.cat) in the city of Barcelona, followed by the creation of a variety of visualizations and predictive models, which are all made publicly available in vacunacovidbarcelona.com.

The visitor of vacunacovidbarcelona.com can explore the result of all these processes, either through the daily visualization of vaccination, the comparison between previous periods, the breakdown of the doses administered (manufacturer, # of doses, sex, age) by district of the city, or the prediction of when the target vaccination of 70% of the population in the city is expected.

Project developed in Google Cloud Platform, fully automated.
